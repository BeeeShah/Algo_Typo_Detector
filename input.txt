Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none 
Ljovee cll, rust s few, eowrong to none

A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool 
A foiol hinks humselg to be wise, byt d eidr msn knows hymsllg to be a fool

There is no darkness, but ignorance
Thherre ij n drknadd, but inorrnce
